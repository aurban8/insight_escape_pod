       "  u'Night Bird Soaring\\nBy T. L. Morganfield',\n",
       "  u'On his sixth birthday, Totyoalli\\u2019s parents took him to the holy city to  see the Emperor Cuauhtemoc, but the plane ride proved the most exciting  part. He kept his nose to the window, taking in the vast lands of the  One World, from the snow-capped mountains of his home in the northern  provinces to the open plains of Teotihuacan. He marveled at the  miniature cities and cars passing below. All his life he\\u2019d dreamt of  flying, ever since the first time he\\u2019d seen a bird gliding through the air.',\n",
       "  u'From the airport, they took a cab to the royal palace on Lake Texcoco.  Tenochtitlan, the single largest city in the world, sprawled around it  for miles. The cab buzzed across one of the royal causeways, the water  blue and shimmering in the hot sun. Inside the walled royal complex  stood the Great Temple, meticulously maintained by a crew of thousands,  its sacred Sun Stone keeping watch over the visiting crowds.',\n",
       "  u'At the palace, two genetically-engineered royal jaguar knights escorted  Totyoalli\\u2019s family to the Emperor\\u2019s gardens. Totyoalli watched their tails swish behind them, fascinated. Their heads looked so soft he  wished to pat them between the ears, but when he tried to talk to them,  they bared their fangs and gripped their spears a little tighter.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u'Ahead, a doorway opened onto a stone patio overlooking an expanse of  grass and trees. Marigolds and birds of paradise choked the flower beds.  Cranes stepped gingerly through the ponds while monkeys chattered in  the trees.',\n",
       "  u'The Revered Speaker stood at the crest of the nearest hill, his hands  behind him and his back to them. \\u201cGood of you to come, Totyoalli.\\u201d He  didn\\u2019t turn. \\u201cLet me take a look at you.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Unafraid, Totyoalli hurried to him. His friends claimed the Revered  Speaker was seven hundred years old, that he\\u2019d been emperor when the  Spanish Devil Cort\\xe9s tried to bring the One World to its knees. Some  said Cuauhtemoc was the War God himself, or maybe the Fifth Sun incarnate, come to Earth to lead the Mexica through a thousand years of  glory. Totyoalli had expected someone very old and wise.',\n",
       "  u'But in fact the Revered Speaker looked hardly out of his teens. He wore  green robes with the sacred day symbols embroidered in gold and silver  thread, and his long black hair was tied back in a complicated knot.  Blue, red, white, and black tattooed lines formed the profile of an  eagle on the right side of his face.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc knelt and kissed the earth at Totyoalli\\u2019s feet, quoting  dedications and blessing him. He then took the boy\\u2019s head in both hands  and granted him the kiss of Divine Grace on his forehead.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cNow that we have the formalities out of the way, walk with me.\\u201d  Cuauhtemoc took Totyoalli by the hand and they moved down the hill, past  the egrets, until his mother and father vanished from sight. They sat  on a stone bench under a grove of willow trees. \\u201cSo, how is calmecac?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli shrugged.',\n",
       "  u'The Revered Speaker\\u2019s smile widened. \\u201cHaven\\u2019t much interest in studying?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI like the learning part, but the other boys say I should go to the  telpochcalli with the rest of the poor kids, and they pick fights.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou haven\\u2019t told them you\\u2019re the Night Wind?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cMother told me not to.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc nodded. \\u201cShe\\u2019s not pleased with your destiny.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli shook his head. His mother wished he weren\\u2019t the Night  Wind; in fact, she\\u2019d gone to great lengths to plan a home delivery, so  the priests and government augurs couldn\\u2019t record the exact time of his  birth. His father had thought her ridiculous, but respected her wishes,  and studied the instructional books to prepare for delivering their baby  himself. No doctor would attend; Totyoalli\\u2019s mother suspected they were  spies for the Temple.',\n",
       "  u'But she couldn\\u2019t fool the gods. After eight intense hours of screaming  with no sign of the baby, Totyoalli\\u2019s father lost his resolve and called  an ambulance. Just seconds after midnight, surgeons brought forth their  son through caesarian and his parents named him Night Bird.  The next morning, the local priest\\u2014dressed all in black and stinking of  the rancid blood he smeared on his body\\u2014came to inform them that the  god Tezcatlipoca had chosen their son as His Teotl Ixiptla, to represent  the god on earth for the Toxcatl\\u2014the Festival of Dryness\\u2014during his  twenty-ninth year. Totyoalli\\u2019s mother had cried almost daily since then.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cHow do you feel about it?\\u201d Cuauhtemoc asked Totyoalli.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cIt\\u2019s always a great honor to serve the gods in such a personal manner,\\u201d  Totyoalli replied, quoting what his father had told him.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou don\\u2019t mind dying before you\\u2019re thirty?\\u201d Cuauhtemoc pressed.',\n",
       "  u'Death shadowed every aspect of life in the One World. People died daily  at the sacrifices, usually broadcast on television, and Totyoalli and  his friends played at death all the time, pretending the dog-god Xolotl  was guiding them through the nine trials of the underworld to reach  Mictlan. Those who ran home crying from scuffed knees or a bloody nose  lost the game and the other boys teased them for days. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll open  death\\u2019s door and find Xolotl left only a pile of shit to guide you!\\u201d  they\\u2019d chant mercilessly. Totyoalli\\u2019s mother thought such games  disrespectful and would he find it so funny when Xolotl sent him into  the underworld alone?',\n",
       "  u'The Revered Speaker was awaiting an answer, so Totyoalli replied, \\u201cDo you fear death, My Lord?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'His face suddenly guarded, Cuauhtemoc said, \\u201cWhy do you ask?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cMy friends say you\\u2019re one of the gods. Is it true? Did you kill the Spanish Devil?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen more than most men.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut are you a god?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc chuckled. \\u201cYou\\u2019re an inquisitive little boy, Night Bird. You do well in the sciences, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m very good at math,\\u201d Totyoalli said unabashedly. \\u201cMy teacher says  I\\u2019m his best student, and someday I\\u2019m going to be an astronaut.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc raised his eyebrows. \\u201cThat takes many years of work, perhaps more than the gods have granted you.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m very good at math,\\u201d Totyoalli insisted.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc patted him on the back. \\u201cCome see me again next year and  we\\u2019ll talk some more.\\u201d He led Totyoalli back up the hill to where his  mother and father waited. As they departed, Totyoalli looked over his  shoulder and waved at Cuauhtemoc. The Revered Speaker waved back.',\n",
       "  u'But his mother grabbed his hand and hissed at him, \\u201cI will not have you playing cute with the man who ordered your execution.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli\\u2019s father bought him a telescope for his tenth birthday, and he  spent nearly every evening out on the back porch, studying the stars\\u2019  steady progression across the sky. His father often sat with him,  testing his son\\u2019s growing knowledge and listening to anything new he\\u2019d  learned. When cold weather moved in, Totyoalli merely donned his coat  and hat for stargazing, if the skies permitted, and his father always  had a cup of hot chocolate waiting. In the summer, they took the  telescope along on camping trips and his father promised, \\u201cNext summer  I\\u2019ll take you to see a rocket launch at Yoatitlan.\\u201d Totyoalli counted  down the days on his calendar.',\n",
       "  u'Then one night, on his way to the bathroom, he overheard his parents talking about him.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cIt\\u2019s not good for him to dream so much,\\u201d his mother said. \\u201cHe\\u2019ll never  go to space. Cuauhtemoc wrote his destiny the moment he was born.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThat\\u2019s how it\\u2019s always been,\\u201d his father replied.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI just can\\u2019t bear to see him struggle for nothing\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be for nothing. He\\u2019ll grow up to be man, perhaps have a family of his own\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cUntil Cuauhtemoc cuts his heart out in front of an audience of millions!\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m not talking about this any more.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Hearing his father approach, Totyoalli hurried to the bathroom. Before  returning to bed, he went to the kitchen and saw his father sitting  outside on the porch, staring at the telescope and sipping a glass of  milky-white octli mixed with soda water. He didn\\u2019t come back inside for  the rest of the night.',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'At the Revered Speaker\\u2019s request, Totyoalli had been visiting the palace  twice a year. His mother didn\\u2019t come along again after that first trip;  Totyoalli\\u2019s father said she never would have gone at all if the Emperor  hadn\\u2019t insisted on meeting her. His father passed the hours with silent  prayer at the Great Temple while his son spent the afternoons in the  gardens with Cuauhtemoc, talking about his classes and interests. Over  the years, the Emperor had come to seem something of a second father to  the boy, but when Totyoalli arrived at the palace that summer, his  mother\\u2019s bitter declarations about Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s intentions weighed heavy  on his mind.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cHave they taught you the names of the planets yet?\\u201d Cuauhtemoc asked as  they followed the winding brook to the south end of the gardens.',\n",
       "  u'Unable to resist showing off his knowledge, Totyoalli rattled off the  long list. \\u201cPiltzintecuhtli, Quetzalcoatl, Cem Anahuac, Huitzilopochtli,  Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, Ometeotl, and Tlaloc.\\u201d He was one of the few  in his class who could recite the names from memory.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc smiled, impressed. \\u201cYour father tells me you\\u2019re very handy  with your telescope. You\\u2019re still planning to be an astronaut?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cMother says I\\u2019m wasting my time. She didn\\u2019t want father to get me the telescope.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cKnowledge is never a waste of time.\\u201d',\n",

He imagined a giant feathered serpent swimming through its  swirling yellow clouds, His home since conflagrating Himself on a pyre  of wood and snakes and ascending to the heavens as the Morning Star.

Surely  one day his fear would get the better of him and he\\u2019d refuse to jump,  and that would end his space career before it ever began. That thought  always made him jump when he hesitated, but he still worried he wouldn\\u2019t  pull his cord in time. Yet even the one time his first chute failed, he  managed to deploy the emergency one.',\n",

If  the priests observed the constellation Tianquiztli rising above them,  Cuauhtemoc would cut Xiuhtecuhtli\\u2019s heart out and light the New Fire in  his chest. Then all the lights would come back on all over the empire  and the masses would celebrate with feasting and sacrifices, to give  thanks to the gods for granting another fifty-two years of mercy.',\n",

Then, on the evening of the Festival of  Dryness, they would escort him to the temple where he was to be stripped  of everything, beginning with his finery and ending with his life. The  following year, they too would die at the various festivals honoring the  goddesses they represented.',\n",

Of everyone he met that  holiday, hers was the only name he remembered: Zaniyo, Alone. He felt  sure the love goddess Xochiquetzal had planted every flower in the world  just for her, and he concocted excuses to walk past her in the gardens  as she studied.',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cI did my first solo jump when I was ten,\\u201d she told him. \\u201cMy grandfather  was an Eagle Knight and he took me up in his plane all the time. I  started tandem-jumping with him at five. He taught me to fly, and I\\u2019m  going to be an Eagle Knight.

       "  u'For the next three days, Totyoalli spent every spare moment helping  Zaniyo with calculus or lounging along the banks of the garden stream  and recounting to her his misadventures with parachuting. They hid from  the trio of giggling girls when they came looking for him, and on the  evening of the New Fire ceremony, Zaniyo invited him to watch it with  her from atop the palace wall.',\n",
       "  u'When they crawled out of the hole in the floor of the southernmost  bastion, a startled jaguar knight hissed at them, but let them run off  down the length of the wall. They stopped halfway and leaned against the  outer edge, gazing down at the dark waters of Lake Texcoco. Totyoalli  savored the warm breeze ruffling his short black hair.',\n",
       "  u'As the city grids fell dark one after another, Zaniyo said, \\u201cIn the old  days, everyone extinguished their fires at the beginning of the  festival. Can you imagine? Five days lit only by the sun?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cSounds like a hassle,\\u201d Totyoalli replied.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThe gods rarely make anything easy for us.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'The land fell dark and silent. It was considered bad luck to speak  during the dark time, and, although Totyoalli dismissed the whole  spectacle as superstitious rubbish, he maintained the traditional  silence. He and Zaniyo stood close together, watching the mountains for  the first signs of fire.',\n",
       "  u'When the flicker finally appeared, distant and dim, Zaniyo grabbed his  hand and squeezed. \\u201cAnd so the world continues a little longer,\\u201d she  breathed with relief.',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cOf course it will continue,\\u201d Totyoalli said with a laugh. \\u201cCuauhtemoc  keeps the gods fat on blood. Why would they want the feast to end?\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'Totyoalli wrote to Zaniyo not quite every day, but enough to irritate  her father, who didn\\u2019t approve of this attention, even from the man  destined to marry his daughter. But soon enough she moved into her dorm  at the Royal Academy and they spent every spare moment together, eating  lunch in the cafeteria and helping each other with homework. On the  short days, at the airfield, Zaniyo showed Totyoalli the controls of the  single-engine planes, and by the beginning of the Hollow Days, she\\u2019d  gotten him flying short distances. They took the zero-gravity simulation  classes together and trained in the mock spacecraft, each doing their  best to one-up the other.',\n",
       "  u'Their playful flirting soon developed into Zaniyo staying over at  Totyoalli\\u2019s apartment for days at a time. Eventually, she moved in.',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'In the spring of his twenty-third year, Totyoalli went on a routine  two-week lunar mission, to the base orbiting Coyolxauhqui\\u2019s Head. Zaniyo  went up three months later and when she returned, they got married, six  years ahead of schedule.\\nThey applied for positions on the expedition to Quetzalcoatl, but  mission control turned them down for lack of experience, encouraging  them to reapply in four years.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut by the time it leaves, we\\u2019ll both be twenty-eight,\\u201d Zaniyo  protested to the mission coordinator. \\u201cEach mission lasts five years;  the government won\\u2019t let us go if we can\\u2019t be back in time for the  Toxcatl. This is our one chance.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou need more experience,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019d done more missions to the lunar base\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWe\\u2019ve taken every mission they offered us,\\u201d Totyoalli said. \\u201cWe just  graduated last year. How can you expect us to have flown more than a  mission apiece yet?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI wish I could make exceptions, but I\\u2019m afraid the rules are explicit.  We require a three-mission minimum.\\u201d The commander sighed. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli wouldn\\u2019t concede defeat. As soon as the next mission call came  up, he signed them on, and they spent two weeks in orbit fixing a spy  satellite. Back home on Earth, they enrolled in a series of deep-space  crisis-training courses so they could take longer missions. The  following summer, they went to the lunar colony for a two-year  assignment. Totyoalli maintained the water recyclers in the geodesic  dome while Zaniyo piloted biweekly supply transports to and from the  orbital station.',\n",
       "  u'When the applicant pool for the Quetzalcoatl expedition reopened,  Totyoalli again added their names, but didn\\u2019t tell Zaniyo. She found out  when their commanding officer delivered the rejection notices and his  condolences.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019ve accepted the fate the gods have handed me. Why can\\u2019t you do the  same and stop dwelling on dreams that we\\u2019re never going to live to see?\\u201d  She refused to speak to him for nearly three days.',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'Six months later, during an orbital mission, he watched Europe pass  silently above his shuttle bunk and wondered whether he and Zaniyo could  flee there and seek political refuge. But Zaniyo would never agree to  go, nor could he leave her behind. She\\u2019s right. Accept your fate and  stop ignoring it.',\n",
       "  u'So he took out the Toxcatl book Zaniyo always packed in his bag when he  went away and finally started reading. He practiced the reed flute he  would play during the ceremony, but he stumbled over the notes; his  breath caught in his chest when he thought of being stripped naked and  cut open on the altar like a frog being dissected.',\n",

       "  u'Totyoalli returned home the day before his twenty-eighth birthday, and  in the morning, after Zaniyo left for work, he drove to the palace to  request an audience with Cuauhtemoc, to beg the Emperor to spare his  life.',\n",
       "  u'While waiting for a jaguar knight to escort him inside, he paced the  courtyard, mulling over what he\\u2019d say. If he hadn\\u2019t known Cuauhtemoc  personally, he\\u2019d never have considered asking him this. Trying to weasel  out of one\\u2019s spiritual responsibilities was considered as dishonorable  now as fleeing a battlefield had been back in the early days of the  empire. If he were smart, he\\u2019d leave now and never tell anyone how he\\u2019d  nearly dishonored his entire family.',\n",
       "  u'But before he could settle on what to say or whether to leave, the  jaguar knight returned and told him the Revered Speaker would see him.  I\\u2019d be dishonoring myself not to fight for what I believe, he decided as  they approached the Emperor\\u2019s study.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc greeted Totyoalli with a firm embrace. \\u201cSo good to see you again, Totyoalli. I trust your mission went well\\u2026.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli nodded and accepted a cup of octli when Cuauhtemoc poured  some. When the Emperor asked for details of the trip, he gave them,  stuttering over nearly every word, and by the time he\\u2019d finished, he was  sweating and the alcohol had soured his stomach.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc, now sitting behind his desk, scrutinized Totyoalli for a moment. \\u201cYou seem nervous. Is something wrong?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Just speak your mind, Totyoalli thought. He set his glass on the table  at the end of the couch, then sat with his hands clasped, making himself  hold Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s gaze. \\u201cI don\\u2019t wish to die, My Lord\\u2026especially for  something I don\\u2019t believe in.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc raised his eyebrows but said nothing.\\n\\u201cMy father always told me there was no greater honor than to serve the  gods like this, but I\\u2019ve never seen anything to suggest that the gods  even exist, let alone that they care what we do one way or another. I\\u2019ve  been to Omeyocan, where all our religious texts say they live, and yes,  there are fabulous wonders out there in space, but no gods demanding  blood in exchange for our passing through\\u2026.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cCertainly you\\u2019ve seen the prelaunch sacrifices?\\u201d Cuauhtemoc replied.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI have,\\u201d Totyoalli admitted, searching for hints that he should stop  pushing his argument and shut up. But Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s gaze was steady and  neutral, so he continued, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not my intention to offend you, Your  Grace, or to criticize our sacred ways, but they contradict everything  science has taught me, everything I believe. Don\\u2019t the gods deserve the  blood of someone who actually reveres them rather than someone who  questions their very purpose in our lives?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc chuckled. \\u201cThe gods hardly care about such trivial details as  dedication and spiritual loyalty; they care about blood, and lots of  it. But I understand your point. A growing number of people believe like  you do.\\u201d He refilled his glass and, after a slow sip, he said, \\u201cThey  sneak off into the night and hide, preferring to  live their lives as outlaws rather than face death on the Eagle Stone.  Just a few months ago, a young man killed a priest and a jaguar knight  when they came to collect him. And a bunch of usually law-abiding  citizens helped him escape the city afterwards. No, you\\u2019re not the only  one questioning the validity of forcing people to the sacrifice.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut until now, no one has ever come directly to me and stated their  dissatisfaction. You do realize that by doing so, you\\u2019re committing  treason against the gods, and I could lock you away in prison until the  day of your Toxcatl?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli nodded, feeling numb.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThe jaguar knights who watch over the prisoners aren\\u2019t known for their  kindness. A year with them and you\\u2019d beg me to kill you. You\\u2019d be better  off just running away like the others.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut that won\\u2019t get me the mission to Quetzalcoatl,\\u201d Totyoalli said.  \\u201cAnd frankly, I think I\\u2019d prefer death to throwing away everything I\\u2019ve  worked for to go on the run. I belong in space or I don\\u2019t belong in this  world at all.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s face relaxed into a proud smile. \\u201cYou never cease to  surprise me, Totyoalli. From the moment I first met you, I knew you were  special. Do you remember what you asked me that day, when we walked in  the garden and I asked you how you felt about being the Night Wind?\\u201d When Totyoalli shrugged, he said, \\u201cYou asked me if I was a god.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI was just a stupid child,\\u201d Totyoalli said, shifting uneasily in his seat.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc peered at him for a moment before saying, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I  want to share with you, something I\\u2019ve rarely told anyone else; then  you can tell me whether your question was really stupid or not.\\u201d He went  to the glass and mahogany showcase behind his desk and took out a human  skull, mildly yellowed with time. \\u201cDo you have any idea whose skull  this is?\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cYou did?\\u201d Totyoalli said, not sure he\\u2019d heard right.',\n",
       "  u'Cuauhtemoc nodded. \\u201cI still remember the smell of the gunpowder, the shouting of the warriors. That night  we celebrated our victory with song and dances around a huge bonfire on  the beach; our victory against history. He would have destroyed  everything we were, everything we had created, and we\\u2019d have vanished  into time, virtually forgotten except as bloodthirsty, freakish  monstrosities.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut look what we\\u2019ve become: we\\u2019re the most powerful nation on Earth,  we\\u2019ve placed colonies on the moon and we\\u2019re traveling to other planets\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cAre you saying you are a god?\\u201d Totyoalli interrupted.',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cArtificial intelligence,\\u201d the Emperor corrected. \\u201cAt least that\\u2019s what they called it where I came from.\\u201d',\n",

       "  u'\\u201cSomewhere that doesn\\u2019t exist anymore,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc replied. \\u201cThey sent  me into the past, in the body of a snake, and I bit one of the nephews  of then-Emperor Motecuhzoma the Younger, which transferred my nanites  into this body.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut why?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cTo prevent the Spanish conquering us. The council elected me Revered  Speaker after Motecuhzoma died in a freak palace fire, and, well, it\\u2019s  been a long seven hundred and thirty-three years, but I\\u2019m still the  Emperor.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cAnd the nanites kept you young all that time,\\u201d Totyoalli said, studying  Cuauhtemoc with new fascination. \\u201cZaniyo was right\\u2026well, not about  you being a god, but about you not aging.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019d rather people think of me as a god,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc replied. \\u201cPeople  are less suspicious of gods. But you don\\u2019t believe in gods; you\\u2019re a  scientist.\\u201d Cuauhtemoc put the skull back on its glass stand in the  cabinet, but then took out a flint dagger. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to  give you. Two things, actually.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to give\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou could have gone into hiding like the others,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc said. \\u201cBut  instead you risked everything and came directly to me. I admire  integrity, and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m releasing you from your obligations.  You\\u2019re no longer the Night Wind. Go to  Quetzalcoatl and take Zaniyo with you, because I\\u2019m releasing her too. Go  study our most Precious Twin and bring home knowledge that will benefit  us far more than your blood ever would.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'For a moment, Totyoalli didn\\u2019t know what to say. Excitement and joy  washed over him like cool water relieving sun-blistered skin, but then  he said, \\u201cCan you do that?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI am the Emperor,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc said as he sat on the windowsill and  turned the knife over and over in his hand. \\u201cBesides, there\\u2019s always the  alternate.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cAlternate?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cEvery Teotl Ixiptla has several. Misfortunes happen.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBut I can\\u2019t send this other man off to die for me. It wouldn\\u2019t be right\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYour alternate is very pious,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc said. \\u201cA priest, in fact.  He\\u2019ll not only go to his death willingly, but with joy in his heart. By  your own rationale, it\\u2019s what the gods deserve.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli sat in shocked silence for a moment before finally saying, \\u201cHow can I ever thank you for your mercy, Your Grace?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cPlease, no more formalities,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc replied. \\u201cI would rather think  of us as friends, and there\\u2019s still one final thing I want to give  you.\\u201d He closed his fist around the stone blade and dragged the knife  through, wincing. When he opened his hand, he coated the blade with  blood. He then held it out to Totyoalli.',\n",
       "  u'After a brief hesitation, Totyoalli took the knife. Cuauhtemoc wrapped  his hand in a length of cloth he took from one of his desk drawers and  said, \\u201cIn my many years, I\\u2019ve had a lot of sons, all of them mortal and  quite foolish in their ambitions, and often not as dedicated to  integrity as the sons of an emperor should be. That\\u2019s why I stopped  fathering children two hundred years ago. But my lack of a reliable heir  has always weighed heavily on my mind. I haven\\u2019t needed one yet, but  even I could fall victim to an injury so severe that my nanites can\\u2019t  fix it, and then what will become of our empire? Will it fall to the  priests, who will ban all scientific research because it might instill  doubt about the gods? Or maybe the military would take over? Can you  imagine what this world would be like run by jaguar knights? No, it must  be someone I trust, someone with integrity. Like you.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli nearly dropped the knife. \\u201cBut I know nothing about running a government!\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cMinor details,\\u201d Cuauhtemoc said, waving him off. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have plenty of  time to learn.\\u201d He studied the bloodied rag for a moment, then said,  \\u201cI\\u2019ve always thought of you as a son, Totyoalli\\u2014the son I\\u2019d always  wished I\\u2019d had\\u2014and that\\u2019s why I offer you this gift. I won\\u2019t make you  accept it, but if you wish to, merely mix the blood with your own. The  shadow of death will never again darken your thoughts.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli didn\\u2019t tell Zaniyo about his conversation with Cuauhtemoc;  instead, he told her the priests had seen omens pointing to the gods  wanting them to go to Quetzalcoatl. This, accompanied by a letter from  the Revered Speaker himself, she accepted with little protest.',\n",
       "  u'He never showed her the knife, either. He kept it in a lockbox at the bottom of his footlocker.',\n",
       "  u'After a month at the lunar space station helping prep the cargo convoy,  Zaniyo and Totyoalli finally boarded the ships for the three-month  journey to Quetzalcoatl. When they arrived, they circled the planet for a  day before meeting up with the ring-shaped space station in a polar  orbit. That same night, Totyoalli stood at the  tiny window in their quarters, gazing out at the turbulent yellow planet  and silently thanking Cuauhtemoc for doing so much to get him there.',\n",
       "  u'For the first several months, Totyoalli worked with the crews  retrofitting the space station with the newly-delivered materials, but  after that he worked on systems maintenance and collaborated on plans  for upgrading the station designs. Zaniyo piloted shuttles, taking  workers and supplies back and forth between the research satellites  deployed around the planet. Fish, beans, maize, and squash lived in the  self-sustaining bio dome, producing enough surplus to feed the convoys  on their trips back to the One World. The station had a temple, but  health and safety issues forbade bloodletting and allowed only fish and  vegetables as sacrifices. Most of the crew preferred symbolic offerings  of fine paper butterflies and snakes, which were easily reabsorbed into  the bio-system and honored the god Quetzalcoatl, who most believed  allowed them to orbit and study His sacred world only by the grace of  His divine mercy. Zaniyo offered Him silent prayers every night.',\n",
       "  u'For months, Totyoalli didn\\u2019t think about the knife or Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s offer  of immortality, but on the eve of his thirtieth birthday, he opened the  lockbox for the first time since placing the blade inside. He lay on  his bunk, holding it by the handle and poking the dried blood on the  blade with his finger. It wasn\\u2019t as hard as he\\u2019d thought it might be; it  gave like a sponge under his prodding.',\n",
       "  u'All it takes is a small cut, he thought, tapping the pad of his index  finger with the tip of the blade. But what about Zaniyo? Cuauhtemoc  hadn\\u2019t given him permission to share this immortal gift with her or  anyone else, but Totyoalli couldn\\u2019t imagine watching her grow old and die while he remained young. Or their children. Or their grandchildren.',\n",
       "  u'Was this why the Emperor had offered it to him? Not so much out of fear  of the end of the empire he had created, but because he\\u2019d grown tired of  watching friends and loved ones come and go with the bundles of years  while he went on and on with no one to share that eternity?',\n",
       "  u'I owe him so much, Totyoalli thought, pressing the blade a little  harder, but still not enough to cut the skin. It\\u2019s the least I can do  for him.',\n",
       "  u'But hearing the door slide open in the other room, Totyoalli quickly  stashed the knife away in the box and buried it under his clothes in the  footlocker.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWe have no octli to celebrate with,\\u201d Zaniyo said as she walked into  their bedroom carrying a bottle and some small cups. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s this  papaya juice.\\u201d She sat on the bottom bunk next to him and poured him a  drink. \\u201cTo the mercy of the gods,\\u201d she said, and they both drank their  cups empty. \\u201cI made you one of those fish tamales you adore so much.\\u201d  She held the foil-wrapped food out to him with a smile.',\n",
       "  u'The tamales smelled fabulous, but the enticing aroma couldn\\u2019t overpower  the longing he felt as he kissed her. He could decide about Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s  gift tomorrow, after he and Zaniyo had celebrated life.',\n",
       "  u'#',\n",
       "  u'The next morning, Totyoalli joined his engineering partner Etl at  storage area sixteen to fix a window fractured by debris. The air in the  storage area had slowly leaked out through the three-inch crack. \\u201cReal  poor quality control on that piece,\\u201d Etl noted as Totyoalli examined the  damage. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to report this glass manufacturer to mission  control, and we\\u2019ll see if they ever get a contract again.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli just replied, \\u201cLet\\u2019s hurry. I\\u2019m having lunch with my wife in  an hour.\\u201d And hopefully Zaniyo wanted a little more than just fish and  tortillas.',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli packed his tools and supplies into his belt pouch and headed  for the airlock. He double-checked his pressure settings, then activated  his magnetic boots. Before stepping out of the open airlock, he hooked  his tether to the rings outside the door. This section had no protective  outer plating yet, so he placed his feet carefully so as not to knock  open any ducts or conduits.',\n",
       "  u'Fifteen minutes later, he reached the window.\\n\\u201cYou and your strolling, Night Bird,\\u201d Etl\\u2019s voice crackled from the foam pads against Totyoalli\\u2019s ears. \\u201cDo you keep your wife waiting like this?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli unsheathed his utility knife and unscrewed the outer brace  while Etl peeled back the seal around the inside. His tether was too  short for him to reach the outer edge, and after contemplating going  back to exchange it\\u2014further irritating Etl\\u2014he decided to unhook it from  his suit, latching the end onto a conduit next to the window. He  increased the power on his magnetic boots and finished unscrewing the  brace. He then hooked the metal frame to a latch on his belt so it  wouldn\\u2019t float away.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cHave you cut the outer seal yet?\\u201d Etl asked.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cIn a minute.\\u201d Totyoalli started slicing through the gummy rubber  coating over the gasket. A couple of minutes later, they carefully  knocked the glass free of its moorings. Totyoalli handed it to his  partner through the six-by-four opening. Etl handed the new pane through  and Totyoalli set it into place. Once it fit snugly, each reapplied  sealant on their side.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cLet\\u2019s make sure it\\u2019s airtight before you screw the brace back on,\\u201d Etl  said. Totyoalli waited while he went to the wall panel and pushed  buttons and turned the dial. Etl then came over to inspect the seal  while Totyoalli scrutinized his side.',\n",
       "  u'At the far right corner, Totyoalli found the sealant bubbling and  splitting. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have proper seal,\\u201d he said into his microphone.\\n\\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll decompress the room again; meanwhile, you should step aside\\u2014\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'A crushing blow sledge-hammered Totyoalli in the stomach. The world spun  around him, a blur of black, white, and yellow that turned red when he  vomited blood into his helmet. He waved his arms, reaching for anything  but finding nothing to grab. His headset buzzed with emergency alarms.  \\u201cEtl,\\u201d he coughed into his microphone, his chest throbbing. \\u201cEtl? Can  you read me?\\u201d Nothing. He couldn\\u2019t see anything beyond the veil of  crimson coating his visor, and already the smell threatened to make him  retch again. \\u201cEtl, come in please!\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cTotyoalli?\\u201d The voice of Azcatl, from station control, burst over his headset. \\u201cWe lost contact with Etl. Are you okay?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m injured.\\u201d Totyoalli cringed when he touched his side and pain shot  through him. A quick feel of the front of his pressure suit found his  control panel smashed. \\u201cThe window blew out.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m sending someone to retrieve you,\\u201d Azcatl said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re out by section thirteen, right?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI can\\u2019t see where I am. And\\u2026I took my tether off.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWhat about your air-thrusters?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cMy control panel is smashed.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Azcatl sighed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ll locate you by your transmission. Just hang on.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli waited, his pain growing with each minute.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cStill there?\\u201d Azcatl\\u2019s voice crackled over the radio again.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWhere else would I be?\\u201d Totyoalli coughed.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cBad news first, friend.\\u201d Azcatl took a deep breath, then said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re  in a reentry vector with the planet and you\\u2019ve just passed out of reach  of our longest tethers.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cAnd the good news?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Azcatl\\u2019s voice faltered for a moment before he managed to say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re  leaking oxygen. You\\u2019ve got maybe a half-hour supply left.\\u201d He tried to  laugh as he added, \\u201cAt least you\\u2019ll die before you burn up.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli stared at the thin crimson veil on his visor and said nothing. All I had to do was prick my damn finger.',\n",
       "  u'Clearing his throat, Azcatl continued, \\u201cI\\u2019ve sent for the shuttle to  retrieve you, but it\\u2019s two hours away, at Satellite Number Three. We  won\\u2019t leave you out there. We\\u2019ll make sure you get back to the One  World, I promise.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Totyoalli whispered, numb.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI\\u2019m going to get Zaniyo, okay?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Totyoalli nodded, unable to speak.',\n",
       "  u'After forever, Zaniyo finally came on the radio. \\u201cTotyoalli, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cAn accident,\\u201d he told her, his voice choked. \\u201cDeath was my destiny all  along.\\u201d She didn\\u2019t say anything, but he heard her suddenly-harsh  breathing. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all right. Don\\u2019t cry.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cHow can the gods be so cruel?\\u201d she demanded. \\u201cTo spare you from the  temple altar just to steal you away like this? How is that fair? Will  they come and take me too?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThe gods didn\\u2019t kill me, Zaniyo. I took my tether off.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cYou\\u2019re not funny,\\u201d Zaniyo said, tears clouding her voice. She sniffled and muttered, \\u201cWhy were you so careless?\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'So I wouldn\\u2019t miss a moment with you. He couldn\\u2019t say it. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry. Forgive me.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cOf course I will,\\u201d she whispered.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cThere\\u2019s something else,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhen you go back to the One World,  return something to Cuauhtemoc. It\\u2019s in a small lockbox. In my  footlocker. Don\\u2019t open it. Promise.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cI promise.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'His breathing was seriously labored now. \\u201cTell him I\\u2019m sorry. I wanted  his gift. But I didn\\u2019t\\u2026. I was afraid. Tell him I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d He  couldn\\u2019t think straight, and he felt sure he was forgetting something.  Finally he sputtered, \\u201cAnd one last thing\\u2026. I love you, Zaniyo.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'He didn\\u2019t know whether she answered him or whether they talked any more  after that. He did think of their first meeting in Cuauhtemoc\\u2019s gardens  and that first kiss that had left his toes numb, and how this morning  he\\u2019d looked at her over their breakfast table and marveled that he was  even alive to enjoy that meal with her.',\n",
       "  u'But now he floated free, Quetzalcoatl spinning peacefully below him. He was Night Bird  Soaring, racing away on outspread wings as he rode the light waves,  skimming Quetzalcoatl\\u2019s upper atmosphere while the clouds twisted and  coiled below him, serpent-like. A large black dog\\u2014the god Xolotl, his  guide in death\\u2014watched from atop the space station, a smile on His face.'],\n",
